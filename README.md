## About
Mastering 4 critical skills using C++17 is a course I found on Udemy that is taught by Dr. Moustafa Saad. I looked into a ton of different C++ courses/textbooks, and his course is the only one where he throws a bunch of challenging exercises that is mean't to start off easy, but builds up difficulty down the road. It's the course I promised myself to finish, so here I am, round two!
